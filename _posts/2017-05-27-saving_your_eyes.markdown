If you're anything like me, you depise bright lights at night.  I enjoy working in a dark envirnment unless the sun is out; between the bright, blue-lit screens of my monitor, TV and cell phone, not only are my eyes completely strained by the end of the night, but I'm also no where near ready to sleep once I shut all the screens off.  All these screens on at night can [affect the quality of your sleep](http://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/blue-light-has-a-dark-side).  Here is a short video dicussing the problems blue light have have on your sleep pattern.  It focuses on light coming from mobile phones but the same can be applied to computer monitors:

Most people can probably work around this problem by simply turning off every screen an hour before they prepare for bed. However, we’re programmers and we code at night. That means we’re staring directly at least a screen or two at night while burning the proverbial midnight oil. Sure, almost all editors have dark themes but most webpages don’t and while browsers may, they don’t affect any of the pages displayed . We’re all also susceptible to staring at our phones when we should be going to sleep. So how do we save our eyes at night? Thankfully, there’s an app for that…or rather, many.

_Before we dive in:_ 

_You should always adjust your focus at least once an hour regardless of the time of day to reduce eye strain. Stare down a hallway or look out the window for a few minutes to give your eyes a break from focusing at something so close to you._

**F.lux**

The first app I use for my computer is [f.lux](https://justgetflux.com/).  Its available on Windows, Mac and Linux for your computer and well as iPhone and Android for phones.  Its a fairly simple setup.  You set up for geographic location (zip code is usually good enough if you're in the U.S.) and the app will then adjust the color tempurature to a _warmer_ tempurature of your screen based on sunset and sunrise at your location.

You can customize the color tempurature during the day and night to fit what feels most comfortable to you if you wish.  Theres also many custom options you can select, from _movie mode_ which cools down the color tempurature a bit for viewing videos to how set you want the app to transition between color tempuratures.

F.lux is an amazing app to reduce eye strain and the amount of blue light your eyes absorb at night, but what if thats not enough?  Those white webpages can still be a real bother, even with a red tint. Enter:

**Dark Reader**

[Dark Reader](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dark-reader/eimadpbcbfnmbkopoojfekhnkhdbieeh)is a chrome extension that inverts the brightness of webpages which helps reduce eye strain. Just switch between normal or inverted colors on your current webpage by using the hotkey _Alt+Shift+A_.

If you want to be able to make your own dark themes for certain websites or don't like how the inverted colors look, you can always use [Stylish](https://userstyles.org/).  They have extensions for Chrome, Firefox, Opera and Baidu, and many user made themes for most popular websites.  They also have a guide for creating your own styles once you create an account.

The last thing left to cover are those pesky browser developer tools.  Even with everything I listed here, that bright and annoying dev tool can really really put a damper on my otherwise beatiful, _easy-on-the-eyes_ screen.  Fortunately, if you're using Chrome, there's also an app for that.

**DevTools Theme: Zero Dark Matrix**

[Zero Dark Matrix](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/devtools-theme-zero-dark/bomhdjeadceaggdgfoefmpeafkjhegbo) is a dark theme for the chrome developer tools. While Chrome now has a dark them option for the DevTools, for now this theme does better with syntax highlighting.

To install: 

* Download the extension from the Chrome web store
* In the url bar, navigate to chrome://flags/#enable-devtools-experiments and click Enable

Relaunch chrome and you should be all good to go!

While I have outlined these apps, there are a plethora of others out there especially for your phone. These just happen to be the tools I use to save my eyes. Regardless, put all these tools together and I’m certain your eyes will thank you by the end of the night, plus you may sleep better from it.
