PhotoSearch is a simple professional quality photo search engine using a React/Redux frontend with a Rails API backend.  You can search for photos by querying the [Unsplash API](https://unsplash.com/). Clicking on the photos will take you to Unsplash's website where you can download the photo if you wish. Thanks the the backend you can also view some of the most recently viewed photos.  You can view the codebase [on Github](https://github.com/jilustrisimo/photo-search-client).
