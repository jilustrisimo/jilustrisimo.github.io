				<p>I believe almost everyone takes a second to gather their thoughts when asked the simple, yet not so simple question <em>why?</em>.  <em>Why</em> do you believe you are right for this company? <em>Why</em> do you want to attend this school? <em>Why</em> do you want to do that? When the context of the conversation is serious enough, that question really causes you to think. It definitely prompts me to have to think, just like it did when I was asked to answer the question, “Why do you want to become a developer?”.</p>

<p>I really had to think about that one.  I was always very into computers when I was a kid.  I had even built my first rig when I was 11.  I had even picked up python for an ephemeral moment in time, but I sadly never persevered with learning it.   Back then I always took my interest in technology as just that, an interest.  None of my other friends were into computers or technology, let alone programming, and the only programming class ever available to me outside of college was a C++ course for seniors my high school offered.  As you may guess, the classes enrollment was low.</p>

<p>I went to college to study International Relations. My interest in computers had become a thing of my past. However, I vaguely remember taking the Myers–Briggs Type Indicator for a GenEd (general education) psychology class.  The test said I was INTP which stands for <em>introversion, intuition, thinking, perceiving</em>. To quote Wikipedia:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>INTPs are marked by a quiet, stoic, modest, and aloof exterior that masks strong creativity and enthusiasm for novel possibilities. Their weaknesses include poor organization, insensitivity to social niceties, and a tendency to get lost in abstractions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For all the test’s faults, it had described me to a tee. Also, unlike most people, I had consistently tested INTP.
I had discovered, in the same class, that some of the “more fitting” careers for an INTP personality included: Computer Scientist, Network Administrator, Software Developer, Web Developer…hm.</p>

<p>Let’s fast forward into my early 20’s. I was looking for a career change and had recently befriended someone who was working as a Network Administrator in NY.  He said his company was looking for a PC tech. We had talked extensively about computers and even though I had no professional experience he thought I could really excel in the field, so I took the leap and the rest was history.</p>

<p>I ended up as Network Admin at that company and I continued my trade at another company afterward.  However, I had felt something was still missing.  Currently, my job had entailed only making sure everything was up and running and if not, fix it.  The biggest thrills I ever got out of the job were if we needed to design a new network for someone because then I would use a little creativity in the matter.</p>

<p>I wanted to be able to create, design and improve on the networks and domains I was working on.  If a client wanted an app, website or some sort of functionality to work a certain way, I wanted to be able to design it myself or at least be part of the process, not just look for a solution that already existed or find someone that knew, then provide back-end support if needed.  Only then did it become clear, no matter how obvious the answer was in the past; it was the next logical step.  I needed to code.</p>

<p>In summary, the answer to the question, “Why do you want to become a developer?” was at least,  for me, obvious.  In fact, my answer may have been the better question to ask.  Why not?</p>
